# Multiprocessor-Communication
Communication in a Bare-Metal Multiprocessor

Lab 1 for EIT/KTH Masters course IL2212 Embedded Software.

Taken from the Lab manual:

1 Objectives
The laboratory introduces a multiprocessor soft-core that will be used during this
laboratory course. Students will receive the necessary design files for the processor
and initial scripts to download the multiprocessor and the software for each core to
an FPGA board.
During this laboratory students shall
 identify the architecture of the multiprocessor analyzing the provided Altera
design files
 investigate possibilities to optimize the memory footprint of an application
 implement an application that demonstrates communication between the different
cores and I/O-handling
 write a short report presenting the features and limitations of the processor
and possible mechanisms for interprocessor communication
Students should take this laboratory very serious, since laboratory 2 will require a
very good understanding of the same multiprocessor.
